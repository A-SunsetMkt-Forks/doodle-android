Doodle Android is an open-source Android app that provides colorful live wallpapers with auto dark mode and power-efficient animations.

The wallpapers are based on the original Doodle live wallpaper collection of the Google Pixel 4 and the leaked (but never officially released) Material You static wallpaper collection of the Pixel 6, extended with additional wallpapers from Chrome OS.  
The app is not just a copy of the original wallpapers, it's a complete rewrite without the permanent animations to save battery and storage space. In addition, there are many customization options to match your preferences.
