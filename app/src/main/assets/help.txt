What's a live wallpaper?

A live wallpaper is an animated image that takes the place of a stagnant image on your home screen. Some live wallpapers are interactive and react to certain gestures on the device.

How to set this as background?

Tap SET in the top right corner, it should appear a preview of the wallpaper. Now tap SET WALLPAPER.

Does it drain my battery?

No. The original Pixel 4 Live Wallpapers were made for powerful high-end processors, they've a continuous animation included which follows the acceleration sensors. Low- and middle-end devices are overwhelmed when rendering these.
That's why I built this App, it allows you to have the Pixel 4 Doodle Live Wallpapers without any battery drain. Therefore the shapes are only moved when you scroll through your home screen pages. Without scrolling, nothing happens and nothing is calculated.

Why does nothing move?

Either you've turned off the parallax effect in settings or there's only one home screen page and nothing to swipe between.
In the first case select "Little" or "Much" in settings, in the second case try adding another page by dragging an app icon to the right.
Another problem could be your launcher, in some cases background scrolling can be turned off in launcher settings.

Are the shapes too small?
Select "big" in settings for the shape scale.

It moves too little.
Select "much" in settings for a stronger parallax effect.
