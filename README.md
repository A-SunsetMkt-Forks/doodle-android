Doodle Android is an open-source Android app that provides colorful live wallpapers with auto dark mode and an battery-efficient parallax effect.  
The wallpapers are based on the original Doodle live wallpapers of the Google Pixel 4. They are completely rewritten, nothing except the look is taken from the original.

## Features

* Stunning wallpaper designs and Pixel feeling

* No ads and no analytics

## Advantages over original Pixel 4 live wallpapers

* Permanent animation (when tilting the device) is optional
* No battery-hungry 3D engine
* Improved text contrast (dark text for light themes instead of white text with shadow)
* Support for Android 11 zoom effect and optional zoom-in animation when unlocking
* Various customization options
* Tiny installation size
* Rendering works well even on less powerful devices (very efficient rendering engine)

## How to set as background
* Tap SET in the top right corner of the app, it should appear a preview
* Now tap SET WALLPAPER

## Compatibility

Doodle Android requires at least Android 6 Marshmallow on your device. The app will work properly on devices without any Google service installed.

You need to turn on background scrolling in your launcher's settings if you have disabled it before to make parallax effect work.
Some launchers don't support background scrolling at all, like Samsung's TouchWiz. As a solution, please try installing another launcher.
