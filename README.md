## Compatibility

Doodle Android requires at least Android 6 Marshmallow on your device. The app will work properly on devices without any Google service installed.

You need to turn on background scrolling in your launcher's settings if you have disabled it before to make parallax effect work.
Some launchers don't support background scrolling at all, like Samsung's TouchWiz. As a solution, please try installing another launcher.
