These live wallpapers are based on the original doodle live wallpapers of the Google Pixel 4.
They are completely rewritten, nothing except the look is taken from the original.

Advantages over the original:
- No permanent animations or gyroscope sensor requests
- Support for Android 11 zoom effect
- Suitable for less powerful devices
- Battery-efficient animations
- Auto dark mode based on the current theme of your device
- Various customization and color options
- Tiny installation size (~3.5MB)

How to set as background:
- Tap SET in the top right corner, it should appear a preview
- Now tap SET WALLPAPER

If you see no movement, you probably have only one home screen page. Drag an app icon to the right edge to add another page, then swipe between them. Parallax effect only occurs during page swipe.

You need to turn on background scrolling in your launcher's settings if you have disabled it before to make parallax effect work.
Some launchers don't support background scrolling at all, like Samsung's TouchWiz. As a solution, please try installing another launcher.
