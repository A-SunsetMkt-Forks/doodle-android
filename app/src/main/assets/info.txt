These live wallpapers are based on the original doodle live wallpapers of the Google Pixel 4.

Advantages over the original:
- Less power consumption because parallax effect only occurs when swiping between pages
- Automatic dark mode based on the current theme of your device
- Customization options

How to set as background:
- Tap SET in the top right corner, it should appear a preview
- Now tap SET WALLPAPER

If you see no movement, you probably have only one home screen page. Drag an app icon to the right edge to add another page, then swipe between them.
You need to turn on background scrolling in your launcher's settings if you have disabled it before to make parallax effect work.
